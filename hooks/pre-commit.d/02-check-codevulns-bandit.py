'''
This hook will run "bandit" on the python source code to find common security issues in Python code.
Here is what this hook does:
1) Checks an installed version of "sabanditfety"
2) If not found, intalls it
3) Runs bandit on the source code and fails/passes the commit
4) You can bypass this and all other hooks using the "--no-verify" flag with the commit
